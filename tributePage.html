                <li><b>1988</b> - Had her only child (son) on August 17th</li>
                <li><b>2012</b> - First to alert the Nigerian Ministry of Health when H1N1 spread to Nigeria.</li>
                <li><b>2014</b> - correctly diagnosed Liberian Patrick Sawyer as Nigeriaâ€™s first case of Ebola at First
                    Consultant Hospital in Lagos, Nigeria in July.
                    Dr. Adadevoh kept Patrick Sawyer in the hospital despite his insistence that he simply had a bad
                    case of
                    malaria. Sawyer wanted to attend a business conference in Calabar, Nigeria.
                    Adadevoh led the team that oversaw Sawyer's treatment.
                    Dr. Adadevoh also kept Patrick Sawyer at the hospital despite receiving a request from the Liberian
                    ambassador to release him.
                    Dr. Adadevoh tried to create an isolation area, despite the lack of protective equipment, by raising
                    a
                    wooden barricade outside Patrick Sawyer's door.
                    Her heroic effort saved the nation from widespread infection. At the time of these events, Nigerian
                    doctors were on strike, which could have led to severe crises.
                    The professionalism and thorough medical examination carried out by Dr. Ameyo Adadevoh was
                    impeccable.
                    Adadevoh also provided staff with relevant information about the virus, procured protective gear and
                    quickly contacted relevant officials. As a result of her report, the Nigerian government declared a
                    national public health emergency and the Nigerian Ministry of Health set up an Ebola Emergency
                    Operations Center.
                    - WHO declared Nigeria to be Ebola-free on October 20, 2014.</li>
